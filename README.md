# Talaarawan

Yet another bullet journal app. But, not really. My intention for this app is to practice backend stuff as I learn about backend stuff. I intend to showcase how a single app can be implemented in different frameworks or barebones. Right now, I am starting with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

## TODOs

### Frontend
- [ ] sketch a wireframe
- [ ] css 'em up

### Backend
- [x] add tasks
- [x] update tasks
- [x] remove tasks
- [ ] set/change type
- [ ] save tasks locally on the browser
- [ ] mvc?
